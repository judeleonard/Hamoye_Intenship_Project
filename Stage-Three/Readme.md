### Course: Machine Learning Classification / Logistic Regression on Stability Of the Grid System 

### Introduction 
Electrical grids require a balance between electricity supply and demands in order to be stable. Conventional systems
achieve this balance through demand-driven electricity production. For future grids with a high share of inflexible(I.e renewable) energy source, the concept of demand response is a promising solution. This implies the changes in the electricity consumption in relation with electricity price changes. 

## Task
In this course we were asked to build a machine learning binary classification model to predict if a grid is stable or unstable.

## Data Set Description 
 Our data is composed of 10,000 rows and 14 columns,which comprises of; 
#### tau1-tau4: 
The reaction time of each network participate.
#### p1-p4:
Nominal power produced either positive or negative consumed by each network participant. 
#### g1-g4:
Price elasticity coefficient for each network participant. 
#### Stab:
Numeric values indicating (-) as stable  or (+) as unstable.
#### Stabf:
Categorical label (stable or unstable).
